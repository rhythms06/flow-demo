# Flow Demo dApp

A rudimentary [Flow](https://onflow.org/) dApp built to document core features of the Flow JS SDK.

It was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:
- `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode
- `yarn build` to build the app for production to `/build/`
- `yarn eject` to leave the automated create-react-app environment
